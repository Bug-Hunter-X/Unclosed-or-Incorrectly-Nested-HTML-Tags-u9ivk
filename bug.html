<p>This is a common error, but it's often hard to track down. The issue arises when you use an HTML tag incorrectly, for example, forgetting to close a tag, or using tags that are not correctly nested. This can lead to unexpected behavior and layout issues. </p><p> Example of incorrect nested tags:</p><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;span&gt;This is a span.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre><p>In this example, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is not closed correctly. The <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag should be placed after the <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag.This can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and even prevent the web page from loading correctly. </p>
