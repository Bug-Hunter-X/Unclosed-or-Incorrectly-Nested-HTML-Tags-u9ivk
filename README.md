# Unclosed or Incorrectly Nested HTML Tags

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error involving unclosed or incorrectly nested tags.  Unclosed or incorrectly nested tags can cause significant issues with rendering and page layout.  The `bug.html` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## Problem
Incorrect nesting or missing closing tags can lead to unexpected layout issues or complete rendering failure.  Browsers attempt to correct these errors, but the results may not be as intended. 

## Solution
Ensure all tags are correctly closed and properly nested.  Use a code editor with HTML syntax highlighting and validation to help prevent these errors.
